🎙️ Emotional Speech Recognition Model
This repository contains a deep learning model for recognizing emotions from speech data. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with additional preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to improve performance.

📂 File Structure
Emotional_Speech_Recognition_Model.ipynb: The main notebook containing the code to build, train, and evaluate the emotional speech recognition model.

📦 Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn opencv-python tensorflow keras

🚀 Getting Started

1. Load and Preprocess Data
Load the speech data and corresponding emotion labels.
Preprocess the data by normalizing audio features and applying augmentation techniques to improve generalization.

2. Model Architecture
The model uses a deep neural network architecture with multiple dense layers and ReLU activations.
The final layer uses a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each emotion class.

3. Training the Model
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.
Model checkpointing is implemented to save the best-performing model based on validation accuracy.

4. Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report.
Visualizations are provided to show the training history, including accuracy and loss over time.

5. Prediction
The model can predict the emotion from a new speech input.
The input audio is preprocessed and fed into the model for prediction.

📊 Results
Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy on the test set, making it suitable for practical applications.
Confusion Matrix: A detailed confusion matrix is provided to visualize the model's performance across different emotions.
Classification Report: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each emotion are reported to give a comprehensive evaluation of the model.

📈 Training History
Plots are included to show the training and validation accuracy and loss over the epochs, helping you understand the model's learning process.

🤖 Usage
Train the Model: Run the notebook to train the model from scratch.
Evaluate the Model: After training, the model's performance is automatically evaluated and visualized.
Predict Emotion: Use the provided code to make predictions on new speech inputs.
